# Shiza Charania

"No matter what you choose, build stuff and be around smart people". This quote by one of the people I look up to in the AI space is how I live my life. Building new projects, challenging myself with difficult problems, reading about different topics, and meeting cool people is what I'm all about. Here, you'll find what I've been up to and some of my exciting projects and experiences!

## What I'm Currently Working On

**Biomedical Imaging Intern | Ryerson University**
* Working with undergrad students to develop a 3D segmentation model for the precise localization of brain tumors (through the [BraTS](http://braintumorsegmentation.org) challenge)
* Working on a research publication to present the project's findings, which will also be presented at an outreach event

**Biomedical Imaging Intern | University Health Network (UHN)**
* Leading the biomedical imaging team to develop a 3D classification model for grading brain tumors
* Working on a research publication to present the project's findings

## Past Projects

**Video Series of Analyzing Research Papers**
* Published [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJvAE3i1UKcK2ZbXx03Z9ojZq77P2U4l3) regarding computer vision research papers I read
* Talked about a variety of topics, including 3D segmentation models, dense cellular segmentation, transfer learning in medical imaging, and glioma grading

**Off-Wind: Adaptive Off-Shore Wind Turbines using 3D and 4D Printing**
* Research project about leveraging 3D and 4D printing to create adaptive off-shore wind turbines, specifically mimicking the structure of plant leaf veins
* This radical solution would provide a 7.8x increase in efficiency, reduce costs by over $5M for each wind turbine, and create the opportunity to repurpose land for other tasks
* Conributed to a [research paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nAumOk37vXRurp2GDQ_vPK-dCmWZ1MrS/view?usp=sharing) going technically deep into the problem and solution (along with building a [website](https://off-wind.github.io), [one-pager](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tks-life-prod.appspot.com/o/items%2F9thVwN6TVzSxezp0UPNb4B704ON2%2FOffWind%20Energy.pdf?alt=media&token=26c64000-ee24-4907-8305-381328a44eb1), and Blender mock-ups)
* Won best presentation, people's choice, and best overall awards at The Knowledge Society's moonshot pitch competition, presenting to over 200 people

**Working Alongside Walmart to Reinvent the Customer Experience for 2030**
* Created a [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vNrfLaeC83xTJQMaKOkUTffzLpR-A4eZ/view?usp=sharing) with proposals to recreate the 2030 physical store environment to be exciting and engaging for customers


**Segmenting Brain Tumours from MRI Scans-93% Accuracy!**
* Developed a [2D brain tumor segmentation model](https://github.com/shizacharania/Brain-Tumour-Segmentation) that can segment brain tumors from MRI scans with 93% accuracy
* Wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@shiza.charania/segmenting-brain-tumours-from-mri-scans-93-accuracy-1b6cfb9bfa0f) explaining the step-by-step process of developing this algorithm
* [Presented this project](https://youtu.be/7rACqsrczAk) at The Knowledge Society

**AI Hackathon Idea: Placenta.ai- Analizying Post Birth Risks**
* Though placentas can provide crucial information about long-term health outcomes for a mother and her baby, less than 10% of all placentas are assessed - this is mainly due to the time-consuming process
* Using computer vision, we can pass a slide placenta a UNET segmentation model, which will segment all the blood vessels in the placenta and pass it through a classification model to evaluate if the blood vessels are diseased
* Made a [one-pager](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_BAjSDjUxYJXJHWoJPYCfPwhdWuw_M-V/view?usp=sharing) and [mock-ups](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fk6-Px6cohNAVwiPX4A42IFZwFUD7na6/view?usp=sharing) of the app that would store the computer vision models' results

**Brain Tumour Classification**
* Developed a [classification model](https://github.com/shizacharania/Brain-Tumour-Classification) to identify pituitary tumours, gliomas, and meningiomas

**CNN for the CIFAR-10 Dataset**
* Developed a [classification model](https://github.com/shizacharania/CIFAR-10) to identify a variety of vehicles and animals from the CIFAR-10 dataset - reached 78.4% accuracy

**Classifier for MNIST and FMNIST Datasets**
* Developed [feedforward neural networks](https://github.com/shizacharania/MNIST-Projects) to classify handwritten digits (from the MNIST dataset) and clothing items (from the FMNIST dataset)
* Wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@shiza.charania/classifying-numbers-and-clothing-items-with-feedforward-neural-networks-86732ba279c2) explaining the step-by-step process of developing these architectures
* Published a code explanation and demo [video](https://youtu.be/NqwG-wCL5nY) for this project
